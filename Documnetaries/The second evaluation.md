# 1 The second evaluation protocol
 
## 1.1The aims

1. Gain customer feedback into existing interactions and interfaces.
2. Get the customer's expectations for the app and compare it to existing apps.
3. Identify the motivations and needs of the customer to use the application.
4. Acquire the customer's assessment of the effectiveness of the app.
 
## 1.2The method of evaluation
 
In the second evaluation, we used Adobe XD to create an interactive High-fidelity prototype. The High-fidelity prototype is closer to the real product than the paper prototype, so the feedback we get is more authentic. In the process, we plan to mainly test our community function, we plan to use think aloud and observation methods to find their true attitude towards our products from the tester's behavior. Specifically, the testers speak their steps and objectives while using the product, and the observer will record the behavior and language that the tester deserves to be recorded throughout the test. In addition, based on the observations we have obtained, we will use the post-event interviews to understand the reasons for customer behavior. It is worth mentioning that in this interview, we will ask questions about the customer's experience - whether the customer can improve the mood through the community function.

## 1.3The preparation
 
We listed all the materials which we needed in the evaluation:
1. Consent forms
2. Task sheet
3. Observation sheet
4. High-fidelity prototype
5. People â€“ Interviewer and recorder
 
## 1.4The process of evaluation:
 
1. We gave our users a brief introduction to our application and we introduced how to use the method of think aloud in the task.
2. Did a little exercise to test if the tester understands how to use think aloud.
3. Give them a task list and ask them to do the task.
4. Encourage testers to explain their intentions while doing the task and pay attention to their doubts and disappointments.
5. After the test, interview the tester based on the observations.

## 2.2  the result of interview

tester 1
1. What is the reason you just clicked the activities area?
Because I thought it was comment area.
2. Can our community function effectively alleviate your bad feelings?
It was useful because I can share my bad feelings with others, which can alleviate my stress.
3. Any confusion and suggestions?
I hope that the interface of the community can be more simple, because the current partition makes me a bit confused.

tester 2
1. What is the reason you just tried to switch the page.
Because I thought there would be something else after switching.
2. Can our community function effectively alleviate your bad feelings?
I think it is useful. I can find people who have the same feelings as me here. This makes me feel like I am not lonely.
3. Any confusion and suggestions?
I think the plus button can be placed in the upper right corner because the current position makes me feel misunderstanding.



tester 3
1. What is the reason you just clicked the UQ button?
Because I think there will be a functional button.
2. Can our community function effectively alleviate your bad feelings?
I think it is useful. Although I don't really need to send content, I am willing to see the content and willing to comfort others.
3. Any confusion and suggestions?
I don't understand what the activity is. And some buttons have no actual features that make me a bit confused.

## 2.3 Analysis and conclusion

From the results we can see that, overall, the testers believe that the community function is effective, they are willing to share their emotions and comfort others on this platform. However, in terms of details, our interface needs to be improved. For the use of some icons, such as the UQ icon and the plus icon, the user will have some misunderstandings that lead to the wrong operation. So, we have to consider this in the final prototyping. In addition, the customer is not very clear about the activity area, which is related to the fact that we did not explain the work at the beginning. We should pay attention to this aspect in the next evaluation.
In addition, due to the limited number of our tests, the feedback received was limited. People's judgments about the app may be too subjective. Therefore, in our final design, we will discuss and research to selectively implement the tester's recommendations.
