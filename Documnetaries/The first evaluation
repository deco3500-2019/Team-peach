We have used TAM and Interview to test our paper prototype. TAM focuses on Peter Morville's useful and desirable in UX Honeycomb. By using TAM, we can test the user's overall attitude towards our counselor functionality. After TAM, we planned to use the interview method which was very helpful in finding the specific reasons for our customers' attitudes. We can improve our prototypes for these reasons and make customers more willing to use the app.

3 Analysis and conclusion

From the TAM test results we can see that, overall, participants believed that our app was easy to use. As can be seen from the picture of distribution, the most frequency scores were 3 and 4. Similarly, all scores in the average figure were higher than 2.5. We can see that the lowest average was PU5, which amounted to 2.5. 
It is worth mentioning that TAM only gave us a piece of quantitative information. We did not know the specific reasons for the user's scoring. Thus, we have interviewed three people randomly after TAM because we wanted to get the tester's specific feedback for detailed function. In addition, we wanted to know the factors that influenced the attitude of the tester. 
Customers liked our concept of counselor and thought that online and expert consultation was really effective in improving mood. From the results of TAM, we found that the current design of the counselor interaction was effective, and the customer's attitude towards this function was positive. However, customers still had some doubts about the design. From the interview results, we found that the customer has misunderstood the plus button of the paper prototype. They were not sure what the function of the plus sign was in the process of use. We will improve it in the design later. In addition, although the customer thought that our app was a good idea and they were willing to recommend it to others. However, they did not like to use it because they did not like to share emotions with others. This was very interesting which was worth exploring afterward.
